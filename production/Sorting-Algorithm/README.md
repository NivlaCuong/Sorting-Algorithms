# Sorting-Algorithms

## Goal of this project:
To show all of sorting algorithms I have learned so far in List as well as Doubly-LinkedList. (Still Updating more algorithms)

After writing all the sorting algorithms I've learned, my plan is to design a website that will demonstrate the process of each algorithm to help others learn Data Structures.

This project will not only help others to learn how each sorting algorithm works, but also prepares me for future careers.

## Run the program:
To run the program and see the result, please run the main method in Main.java 

I'm working on the testing
